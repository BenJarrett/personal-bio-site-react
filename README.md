# Features I would like to add
- I would like to add more styling of the homepage. I did not finish. 
- Scrolling Tech list. 
- When clicking on each art of the nav bar, I would like the dcreen to adjust to where that information is on the home page. 
- I would like the login button to only appear when I type in a path in the Url so tha tit would not be visible to visitors bc they cannot use it to log into anything. 
- An updated bio without dummy data. 
- More of my projects. 
- More styling of the project cards and the project view. 
- A section that shows group projects, individual projects, and personal projects not related to NSS.
- Mobile responsiveness
- Link to the project's Github url on the card. 
- A button to show more information on each project. 
- A Preview of my Zoom video showing off the project. 
- Allow the Email button to directly open an email to me for the use that clicks on it.
